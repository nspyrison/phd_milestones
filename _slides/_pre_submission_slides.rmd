## Introduction

- Multivariate data visualization
- Data visualization _tour_; continuous linear projection over small changes in the projection basis
- _radial tour_ (RO#1); given a basis, variable and direction to change using geodesic interpolator, to change it's contribution
- Efficacy of the radial tour (RO#2); $n=108$ within-participant user study against the alternatives PCA and grand tour
- Improving the interpretability of black-box models using the radial tour (RO#3)

---

## Motivation

- _Exploratory data analysis_ is important for understanding the data and testing the validity of assumptions
- Data visualization is more robust and thorough than statistical summarization alone
- Tours are one way to extend our ability to visualize data space as dimensions increase
- Exploratory Artificial Intellegence (XAI), growing tension of accuracy and interpretability of black-box models.

## Linear projections & orthonormal basis

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/linear_proj.png")
```

---

## Research objectives & methology

__Can the manual tour help analysts understand linear projections and explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to the variables contributing to the projection?__
<br>

- 1) Define user interaction for the manual tour to add and remove variables from a 2D linear projection
    - *Algorithm design*, develop and apply user interaction; R package `{spinifex}` _Spyrison, et al, 2019_
- 2) Do analysts better understand the relationship between variables and structure in a 2D linear projection better when the interactive manual tour is available?
    - *Experimental study*, $n=108$ within participant user study comparing radial tours with PCA, and the grand tour.
    - briefly get into the model and results
- 3) Can the geodesic interpolator be used in conjunction with the local explanation, SHAP, to improve the interpretability of black-box models?
    - *fundamental visualization design*, how can we use the radial tour to explore the structure identified in local explanations of a black-box model

# RO#3, Radial tour and local explanations

---

## Local explanations

- Point-measurement, the variable weights of the importance to the model
- Applied 1 observation, given a model

```{r echo = F, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/lime_nonlinear.png")
```
Ribeiro, M. et. al. (2017). Why Should I Trust You?

## SHAP values

- We apply use the model-agnostic explanation, SHAP, to random forest models.
- Approximates importance to the model with the median importance, permuting over combinations of the explanatory variables

## Future work -- Interactive 3D GI (RO #3)

.large[.large[
2D GI rotates a 2D basis in a 3D manipulation space with 2 angle parameters.

Analogously, 3D GI rotates a 3D basis in a 4D manipulation space with 3 angle parameters.

- Define the 3 axes of rotation
- Solve for the rotation matrix by application of Rodrigues' formula
- Attention to sign changes (4D and trig functions supporting half a rotation)

## Future work -- 3D GI usability study (RO #4)

.large[
Option 1: implement using `shinyaframe` and append to the `shiny` application addressing RO #2
- Pro: faster implementation and reuse of previous implementation
- Con: unknown extent and extendibility of user interaction
- Proof of concept; _Hadjar et al. (2018)_ user interaction changing axes on a 3D scatterplot 

Option 2: implement in `Unity` and implement a new application for experimental study
- Pro: unimpeded extendibility of user interaction 
- Con: slower implementation and slower and rework implementation
