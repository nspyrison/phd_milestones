## Introduction

- Multivariate data visualization
- Data visualization _tour_; continuous linear projection over small changes in the projection basis
- _radial tour_ (RO#1); given a basis, variable and direction to change using geodesic interpolator, to change it's contribution
- Efficacy of the radial tour (RO#2); $n=108$ within-participant user study against the alternatives PCA and grand tour
- Improving the interpretability of black-box models using the radial tour (RO#3)

---

## Motivation

- _Exploratory data analysis_ is important for understanding the data and testing the validity of assumptions
- Data visualization is more robust and thorough than statistical summarization alone
- Tours are one way to extend our ability to visualize data space as dimensions increase
- Exploratory Artificial Intellegence (XAI), growing tension of accuracy and interpretability of black-box models.

## Research objectives & methology

__Can the manual tour help analysts understand linear projections and explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to the variables contributing to the projection?__
<br>

- 1) Define user interaction for the manual tour to add and remove variables from a 2D linear projection
    - *Algorithm design*, develop and apply user interaction; R package `{spinifex}` _Spyrison, et al, 2019_
- 2) Do analysts better understand the relationship between variables and structure in a 2D linear projection better when the interactive manual tour is available?
    - *Experimental study*, $n=108$ within participant user study comparing radial tours with PCA, and the grand tour.
    - briefly get into the model and results
- 3) Can the geodesic interpolator be used in conjunction with the local explanation, SHAP, to improve the interpretability of black-box models?
    - *fundamental visualization design*, how can we use the radial tour to explore the structure identified in local explanations of a black-box model

# RO#2: User study

- $n=108$ with-in participant
- Crowdsourced with prolific.co

---

## User study task

- TODO

---

## Experimental factors

- random effects mixed regression model regressing:
- $y$, accuracy

.large[.large[
Experimental study:
- Hypothesis: _Does the finer control afforded by radial tour improve the ability of the analyst to understand the importance of variables contributing to the structure?_
- Primary factor: principal component analysis, grand tour, and radial tour
- Block factors: _location_ mixing of signal and noise var, _shape_ of distribution, and _dimension_-ality of the data.
- $n=108$, Within-participant study; all participants performed on each of the 3 visuals
- Implemented via `shiny` application, crowdsourced via `prolific.co`
- Draft of paper included as appendix A of the milestone document (JDSSV)

This is my assessment of the completion of the thesis drafting thus far:

- Introduction – 60%
- Literature review – 80%
- (RO #1) 2D GI – 90%
- (RO #2) 2D GI Experimental study – 40%
- (RO #3) 3D GI – 0%
- (RO #4) 3D GI Experimental study – 0%
- Conclusion and future plans – 0%

## Research timeline

## Future work -- Interactive 3D GI (RO #3)

.large[.large[
2D GI rotates a 2D basis in a 3D manipulation space with 2 angle parameters.

Analogously, 3D GI rotates a 3D basis in a 4D manipulation space with 3 angle parameters.

- Define the 3 axes of rotation
- Solve for the rotation matrix by application of Rodrigues' formula
- Attention to sign changes (4D and trig functions supporting half a rotation)
]]

## Future work -- 3D GI usability study (RO #4)

.large[
Option 1: implement using `shinyaframe` and append to the `shiny` application addressing RO #2
- Pro: faster implementation and reuse of previous implementation
- Con: unknown extent and extendibility of user interaction
- Proof of concept; _Hadjar et al. (2018)_ user interaction changing axes on a 3D scatterplot 

Option 2: implement in `Unity` and implement a new application for experimental study
- Pro: unimpeded extendibility of user interaction 
- Con: slower implementation and slower and rework implementation
