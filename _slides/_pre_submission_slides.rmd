- Motivation
- Research objectives & methology
- Refresher: linear projections
RO#2:\
- User study model
- User study results
RO#3:\
XXX, TODO

## Introduction

- Multivariate data visualization
- Data visualization _tour_; continuous linear projection over small changes in the projection basis
- _Radial_ tour (RO#1); given a basis and variable to manipulate, rotate its contribution to full, zero, and back to the initial
- Efficacy of the radial tour (RO#2); $n=108$ within-participant user study against the alternatives PCA and grand tour
- Improving the interpretability of black-box models using of tours
-- Local explanation of black-box models 

---

## Motivation

- _Exploratory data analysis_ is important for understanding the data and testing the validity of assumptions
- Visualization is more robust and thorough than statistical summarization alone, _Eg._ datasaurus dozen below
- Tours are one way to extend our ability to visualize linear data space as dimensions increase

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/AllDinosAnimatedSmaller.gif")
```
_(Matejka & Fitzmaurice, 2017)_

<!-- ## Type/scope of the data -->

<!-- __Multivariate tabular,__ $n$ observations of $p$ attributes -->
<!-- - Can be feature- or parameter- decomposition of non-standard formats -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width = '90%'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/tmunzner_vad16.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- _(Munzner, 2014)_ -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Linear projections -->

<!-- - Simple dimension reduction, highlight interesting features -->
<!-- - Analytical procedures: -->
<!--     - Principal component analysis (PCA) -->
<!--     - Linear discriminant analysis -->
<!--     - Multiple regression -->
<!-- - Visual procedures: -->
<!--     - _Tour_, animation of many frames that are close -->
<!--     - Types: grand, guided, little, local, manual (most available in `tourr` R package) -->
<!--     - Method to control the contribution of a single variable _(Cook & Buja, 1997)_ -->

<!-- __Shadow analogy:__ -->
<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width = '65%'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/shadow_puppet.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->

## Linear projections & bases

Linear projections are specified by their basis
- Each column is a linear combinations the original variables
- _Orthonormal_: all columns at right angles (orthogonal) and of length 1 (normal)

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '82%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/basis.png")
```

---

<!-- ## Geodesic interpolation (GI) -->

<!-- Selection of intermediate bases along the shortest path of orthonormal bases. -->

<!-- - Used in other tour methods including the grand tour _(Asimov, 1985)_ -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width = '62%'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/buja05fig.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- _(Buja et al., 2005)_ -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Sensitivity of structure in a projection -->

<!-- - Some variables are more sensitive to the structure within a projection -->
<!-- - Illustrated by controlling variable contributions: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width = '87%'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/basisStructure.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->

## Research objectives & methology

__Can user-guided geodesic interpolation help analysts understand linear projections and explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to the variables contributing to the projection?__
<br>

- 1) Define user interaction for a geodesic interpolator to add and remove variables from a 2D linear projection
    - *Algorithm design*, develop and apply manual interaction; R package `{spinifex}` _Spyrison, et al, 2019_
- 2) Do analysts better understand the relationship between variables and structure in a 2D linear projection better when the interactive geodesic interpolator is available?
    - *Experimental study*, $n=108$ within participant user study comparing radial tours with PCA, and the grand tour. Below we'll briefly get into the model and results
- 3) Can the geodesic interpolator be used in conjunction with the local explanation, SHAP, to improve the interpretability of black-box models?
    - *visualization design*, how can we best view the sensitivity of the SHAP matrix, and what can we gain by exploring a single local explanation with radial tours

## User study model

- random effects mixed regression model regressing:
- $y_1$, accuracy, $y_2$, response time.

.large[.large[ 
Experimental study:
- Hypothesis: _Does the finer control afforded by GI improve the ability of the analyst to understand the importance of variables contributing to the structure?_
- Factors: principal component analysis, grand tour (grand), and 2D GI
- Within-participant study; all participants will perform all factors
- Implemented via `shiny` application
- Draft of paper included as appendix B of the milestone document

## Future work -- Interactive 3D GI (RO #3)

.large[.large[
2D GI rotates a 2D basis in a 3D manipulation space with 2 angle parameters.

Analogously, 3D GI rotates a 3D basis in a 4D manipulation space with 3 angle parameters.

- Define the 3 axes of rotation
- Solve for the rotation matrix by application of Rodrigues' formula
- Attention to sign changes (4D and trig functions supporting half a rotation)
]]

## Future work -- 3D GI usability study (RO #4)

.large[
Option 1: implement using `shinyaframe` and append to the `shiny` application addressing RO #2
- Pro: faster implementation and reuse of previous implementation
- Con: unknown extent and extendibility of user interaction
- Proof of concept; _Hadjar et al. (2018)_ user interaction changing axes on a 3D scatterplot 

Option 2: implement in `Unity` and implement a new application for experimental study
- Pro: unimpeded extendibility of user interaction 
- Con: slower implementation and slower and rework implementation
